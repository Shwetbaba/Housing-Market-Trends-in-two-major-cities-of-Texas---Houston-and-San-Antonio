# Project 2: Exact, Transform, Load 
## Housing Market fluctations in four major cities of Texas
---

## Description
This project will be evaluating the housing market fluctations in San Antonio, Texas. The Team will evaluate the living preferences (renting vs owning) of persons currently living in and/or planning on relocating to Texas. We will use multiple data sources to determine if there is a correlation between their occupation(industry), income level, or even location that drives their selection in housing preferences.

**Motivation**
There appears to be an increase in population in San Antonio and surrouding areas, as there are multiple housing and commerical structures being erected seemingly weekly. The purpose of this analytical research is to evaluate what factors are responsible for the fluctations in the housing market. Are the prices of homes being driven by consumer choice (opting for apartments over the traditional single family house)? 

We will be extracting and examining data from various counties in areas around San Antonio to see if a trend can be identified. This information can prove to be useful to new property developers and real estate investors who are evaluating their porfolios.


## Research Questions asked and Answered
1] Is there a correlation between income, type of jobs versus choice of housing accommodation?
2] What are the future housing market trends will look like?
